This all-in-one SEO plugin can rewrite title tags, noindex archives, and customize meta data (with many more features coming soon).

== Description ==

SEO Ultimate is an all-in-one [SEO](http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/) plugin with these features:

* **Title Rewriter** - Lets you format the `<title>` tags of posts, pages, categories, tags, archives, search results, the blog homepage, and more.

* **Noindex Manager** - Lets you add the `noindex` meta robots instruction to archives, comment feeds, the login page, and more.

* **Meta Editor** - Lets you edit the meta descriptions/keywords for your posts, pages, and homepage. Also lets you enter verification meta codes and give code instructions to search engine spiders.

SEO Ultimate was developed with WordPress plugin "best practices" in mind:

* Integration with WordPress's contextual help system
* Internationalization support
* Nonce security
* An uninstall routine
* Integration with the new WordPress 2.7 menu

**NOTE:** This plugin is in beta, which means it's very feature-incomplete. We have many more features that we're working on finetuning before release, including 404 monitoring, canonical tag insertion, PageRank sculpting, and more.

If you install the plugin now, you can have these new features delivered to you on a regular basis via WordPress's automatic plugin upgrader.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where in WordPress does the plugin add itself? =

SEO Ultimate puts all its admin pages under a new "SEO" top-level menu. The only exception is the plugin settings page, which goes under `Settings > SEO Ultimate`.

= Some of the features aren't working! =

Here are some troubleshooting ideas:

1. Try disabling other SEO plugins (they may be conflicting with SEO Ultimate).
2. Check to make sure your theme is [plugin-friendly](http://wordpress.jdwebdev.com/blog/theme-plugin-hooks/).

= How do I remove the attribution link? =

Because of the tremendous effort put into this plugin, we ask that you please leave the link enabled. If you must disable it, you can do so under `Settings > SEO Ultimate`.
