This all-in-one SEO plugin can rewrite title tags, noindex archives, customize meta data, and insert canonical tags (with many more features coming soon).

== Description ==

SEO Ultimate is an all-in-one [SEO](http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/) plugin with these features:

* **Title Rewriter** - Lets you format the `<title>` tags of posts, pages, categories, tags, archives, search results, the blog homepage, and more.

* **Noindex Manager** - Lets you add the `noindex` meta robots instruction to archives, comment feeds, the login page, and more.

* **Meta Editor** - Lets you edit the meta descriptions/keywords for your posts, pages, and homepage. Also lets you enter verification meta codes and give code instructions to search engine spiders.

* **Canonicalizer** - Inserts `<link rel="canonical" />` tags for your homepage and each of your posts, Pages, categories, tags, date archives, and author archives.

SEO Ultimate was developed with WordPress plugin "best practices" in mind:

* Integration with the contextual help system of WordPress 2.7+
* Internationalization support
* Nonce security
* An uninstall routine
* Integration with the new WordPress 2.7+ menu

**NOTE:** This plugin is in beta, which means it's very feature-incomplete. We have many more features that we're working on finetuning before release, including 404 monitoring, PageRank sculpting, robots.txt editing, and more.

If you install the plugin now, you can have these new features delivered to you on a regular basis via WordPress's automatic plugin upgrader.
