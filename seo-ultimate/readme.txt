This all-in-one SEO plugin can rewrite title tags and noindex archives (with many more features coming soon).

== Description ==

SEO Ultimate is an all-in-one [SEO](http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/) plugin with these features:

* **Title Rewriter** - Lets you format the `<title>` tags of posts, pages, categories, tags, archives, search results, the blog homepage, and more.

* **Noindex Manager** - Lets you add the `noindex` meta robots instruction to archives, comment feeds, the login page, and more.

SEO Ultimate was developed with WordPress plugin "best practices" in mind:
* Integration with WordPress's contextual help system
* Internationalization support
* Nonce security
* An uninstall routine
* Integration with the new WordPress 2.7 menu

**NOTE:** This plugin is in beta, which means it's very feature-incomplete. We have many more features that we're working on finetuning before release, including meta editing, 404 monitoring, canonical tag insertion, PageRank sculpting, and more.

If you install the plugin now, you can have these new features delivered to you on a regular basis via WordPress's automatic plugin upgrader.
